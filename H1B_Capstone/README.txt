This repository contains the files associated with my first capstone project. Predicting H1B LCA Applicaiton Success.

For this project I used a dataset from Kaggle and attempted to predict the outcome of the H1B LCA application process (accepted or denied). There are overwhelmingly more accepted applications than denied applications so, while my model does not perform better than flipping a coin, I got experience working with machine learning algorithms as well as heavily unbalanced data.


Folders:
  data - this folder holds the data I used for the project. This includes the original and cleaned kaggle dataset as well as the outputs from the FCC and Census API scripts.
  
  jupyter_notebooks - this folder contains jupyter notebooks created as part of the capstone project
  
  python - this folder contains .py files I created
  
  Summaries - This folder contains writeups for the various steps of the capstone project process.

This folder contains the python scripts that I used throughout the capstone.

Files:

avg_image.py - This is the script I used to generate the average images for each of the photo categories

FF_Neural_Net.py - this contains the code that created, trained, and validated my feed-forwarnd neural net model 

Image_EDA.py - this contains the code I used to sum and plot the frequency of color channel values for the different categories

Log_Reg.py - this contains the code that created, trained, and validated my logistic regression model 

Res_Net_TL.py - this contains the code that created, trained, and validated my ResNet101 model 

Select_Final_Test_Set.py - this is the code that I used to select the 10 photos to use to visualize the performance of each of my models

Simple_CNN.py - this contains the code that created, trained, and validated my simply convolutional neural net model 

Visualize_Models.py - this is the code that I used to evaluate the performance of my models on the same 10 photos and output those results as .png images
